           <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
           <p>Our goal at KAP (Keep ATX Protesting) is to provide an easy to use platform for residents of Austin, Texas to communicate with each others to organize protests.
              As students, we have noticed the haphazard organization of protests and wanted to increase particpation rates by introducing KAP: a way to faciliate effective communication and organization of protests so we can all achieve our goals!
